Hidden Markov Model-Machine_Learning
====================================
Machine Learning Design Project in SUTD, Singapore

#In A Nutshell
* POS and NPC files contain all the data and code needed for the word sequence tagger.<br>
* When using it, simply comment unnecessary code of other parts and then run the file, you will get the accuracy and the output document respectively.<br>
* The final accuracy for the POS tagger reach a leval of `82.2%`. Considering there are `40+` tags, the score is fairly good.<br>
* The accuracy of part5 with training data and develop data both to train the algorithm can reach `87.92%` at the test dataset.We won No.1 among all the systems developed by the groups of this course.<br>

#NOTE
When using HMM(Hidden Markov Model), we applied smoothing technique to improve the accuracy. Absolute discounting and word preprocessing is used in this project. I also recommend you to try Kneser Ney Smoothing, which may give even better result.
