# HMM-Machine_Learning
Machine Learning project in SUTD, Singapore

#In A Nutshell

POS and NPC files contain all the data and code needed for the word sequence tagger.
When using it, simply comment unnecessary code of other parts and then run the file, you will get the accuracy and the output document respectively.
The final accuracy for the POS tagger reach a leval of 82.2%. Considering there are 40+ tags, the score is fairly good.

#NOTE

When using HMM(Hidden Markov Model), we applied smoothing technique to improve the accuracy. Absolute discounting and word preprocessing is used in this project. I also recommend you to try Kneser Ney Smoothing, which may give even better result.


I want to use Machine Learning to Make Love with the world.
