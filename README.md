# HMM-Machine_Learning
Machine Learning project in SUTD, Singapore

·In a nutshell
POS and NPC files contain all the data and code needed for the word sequence tagger.
When using it, simply comment unnecessary code of other parts and then run the file, you will get the accuracy and the output document respectively.

·NOTE
When using HMM(Hidden Markov Model), we applied smoothing technique to improve the accuracy. Absolute discounting and word preprocessing is used in this project. I also recommend you to try Kneser Ney Smoothing, which may give even better result.


Hope this will help you.
